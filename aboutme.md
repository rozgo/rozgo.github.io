# About Me

## Alex Rozgo
**AI Engineer for games and simulations**

I specialize in pioneering Procedural Augmented Generation (PAG) systems - a novel approach that brings the power of generative AI to procedural content creation in games and simulations. By feeding multi-modal contexts (images, descriptions, game states) into dynamic pipelines, I create systems that generate contextually aware, responsive virtual worlds.

My work spans the full spectrum of AI-driven game development: from designing multi-agent frameworks and behavior systems that exhibit emergent properties, to building real-time synthetic data pipelines that train next-generation AI models. I lead the creation of open-source platforms that bridge the simulation-reality gap, enabling seamless transitions between virtual testing and real-world deployment.

What drives my approach is the integration of live feedback loops - monitoring player behavior, AI agent actions, and environmental states to continuously refine generation parameters. This creates truly responsive experiences where NPCs dynamically adapt, environments evolve based on usage patterns, and virtual worlds feel genuinely alive. I combine physics-based dynamics with computer vision, fine-tune LLMs for embodied AI and behavior trees, and architect scalable pipelines for virtual production.

My focus areas include synthetic environments for human-machine tactics training, massive multi-agent physics simulations that accelerate engineering processes, reinforcement learning pipelines that push the boundaries of AI behavior, and custom 3D engines optimized for AI-driven experiences. Every system I build emphasizes the critical intersection of human creativity and machine intelligence.

## Philosophy
> "With four parameters I can fit an elephant, and with five I can make him wiggle his trunk."

## Interests
I'm interested in crazy ideas, body tech upgrades, life extension, curing cancer; or creating virtual worlds where none of this matters.

## Experience
- **20+ years** developing games
- **9+ years** building for mobile platforms
- **8+ years** working with Unity3D
- Extensive experience with **Unreal Engine 4** - my engine of choice
- Specializing in **physics, AI and control systems** for immersive VR/AR experiences
- Platforms: HTC Vive, Oculus, and various AR systems

## Technical Approach
Nothing is harder than building simple things. I manage complexity by building blocks from first principles. Love the speed of C and beauty of Haskell. I'm functional first, design with types and develop with tests.
